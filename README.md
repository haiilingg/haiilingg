### Intro 👩‍💻

Hello, I'm Hai Ling. 

I previously worked as an auditor but not anymore ! After months of debating what I wanted to do before quitting my job, I have came to the conclusion that DATA is where my interest lies.

It all started with DataCamp, which was introduced to me by my friend 2 years ago. There was where I discovered to power of Python and SQL. Despite working with data everyday in my previous job, I used Excel and Excel has its limitations which could be easily overcame by using Python or SQL.

And here I am now, writing this on github 🤓

If you have a similar experience, high 5 ✋

### Long story short:

🔭 I’m currently working on a SQL project for Code First Girls (CFG)

🌱 I’m currently learning Python & SQL
