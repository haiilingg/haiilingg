### Intro 👩‍💻

Hello, I'm Hai Ling. 

I previously worked as an auditor but not anymore ! After months of debating what I wanted to do before quitting my job, I have came to the conclusion that DATA is where my interest lies.

It all started with DataCamp, which was introduced to me by my friend 2 years ago. There was where I discovered to power of Python and SQL. Despite working with data everyday in my previous job, I used Excel and Excel has its limitations which could be easily overcame by using Python or SQL.

Instead of abandoning my previous experience, I'm looking for roles that allow me to combine both my knowledge in finance with what I've learnt for the past few months in data analytics/ data visualisation. 2 is better than 1 righttt!

Feel free to have a look at the work I've done and I'm more than happy to chat further :)

### Long story short:

🌱 I’m currently interning as a Data Analyst Trainee at Digitas Malaysia, analysing web data (eg how well the websites are performing)
